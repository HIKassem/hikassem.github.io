abstract = {The main focus of this paper is on the free vibration and flutter characteristics of high aspect ratio aircraft wings and the investigation covers two sailplanes and two medium to long range transport airliners. The wings are idealised as an assembly of bending-torsion coupled beam elements with cantilever boundary condition at the root. The dynamic stiffness method is used to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the wings. The first six natural frequencies and mode shapes are computed and the results are compared and contrasted. Following the modal analysis, flutter analysis is carried out using the normal mode method in conjunction with generalised coordinates and two dimensional unsteady aerodynamic theory of Theodorsen. Flutter speeds and flutter frequencies are obtained for all of the four aircraft. The results are discussed and some conclusions are drawn.},

@article{kassem2012integrating,
abstract = {This work compliments our recently published work of implementing the eddy dissipation turbulent combustion model in OpenFOAM [1]. The major update proposed herein is linking the EdmFoam1.5 solver with radiation modeling libraries in OpenFOAM. The new solver was validated against experimental data for jet and swirling Sydney flame (SM1). Each case was modeled with/without radiation modeling. The results have a fair agreement in general. In jet flame cases, the radiation modeling has a good impact on refining the predicted results. However it has not the same great effect on the swirling flame case. A review of the EDM applications in different reacting flow problems is also presented and discussed.},

@article{saqr2012computational,
abstract = {In this article, we present three dimensional CFD study of turbulent vortex flow in an annular passage using OpenFOAM 1.6. The vortex flow is generated by introducing the flow through a tangential entry to the passage. For the analysis presented in this article, turbulence was modeled using the R$\epsilon$/k\&xa0;\&xa0;$\epsilon$ model, in addition, a comparison between such model with the standard k\&xa0;\&xa0;$\epsilon$ model was conducted and discussed. The main characteristics of the flow such as vortex structure and recirculation zone were investigated. It was found that flow is subjected to Rankine vortex structure with three forced vortex regimes and a free vortex region near to the outer wall. The phenomenon of vortex decay was investigated by depicting the swirl number trend along the axial direction of the flow domain. It was found that the vortex decay is subjected to an exponential decay behavior. New coefficients for the exponential decay correlation were derived based on local values of velocity components in different radial planes.},
