      <p>Welcome to my personal website and blog. Currently,
      I’m a PhD student at <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/">City University London</a>
      working on fluid-structure interaction problems (aeroelasticity).
      I use mainly <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">open source</a>
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">"FREE"</a>
      tools in my research, in particular,
      <a href="http://openfoam.org/">OpenFOAM</a>,
      <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a>,
      <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a> ,
      <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a>,
      <a href="http://www.salome-platform.org/">Salome</a> and
      <a href="http://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>.

      these tools with a special focus on <a href="http://openfoam.org/">OpenFOAM</a>.</p>
