**Hello**,

Welcome to my blog, here, I will share with you some tips and ideas about
OpenFOAM in particular and other open source code which I use regularly.
I thought many times before about creating a blog about OpenFOAM but I never
had a chance. Today, there are many resources and blogs available online about
OpenFOAM which were not available when I started using it six years ago.

However, most of them focus on how to run OpenFOAM except few blogs which
highlight the programming side of OpenFOAM. I will do my best to focus on the
programming side as well as the setup of some challenging problems.
Also, I will try to test some of the new features in OpenFOAM-dev which
eventually will be part of the upcoming versions.

Best wishes,

`Hassan Kassem`
